## Pretrained Model
[Grounding DINO-B](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/main/configs/grounding_dino)

## Training

To train the model:

3 x L40, 50 Epochs.

```python
bash ./mmdetection/tools/dist_train_muti.sh ./mmdetection/configs/grounding_dino/CDFSOD/GroudingDINO-few-shot-SwinB.py "0,1,2" 50
```

## Test

```python
bash ./mmdetection/tools/dist_test.sh ./mmdetection/configs/grounding_dino/CDFSOD/GroudingDINO-few-shot-SwinB.py /path/to/model/ "0,1,2"
```
